# AppReconstructor
## Goal & Mission Statement:
Make an AI that can decompile apps, and also have it examine running code and memory & storage files, on a standard & "licensed" install from Google Play running on rooted Android, or using hacking tools like a **bus pirate**: to extract, modify, & reconstruct locked down and restricted apps.

With this running app in memory image it would also be possible to use components from the app and even individual functions or objects and an entirely new interface and app created by SuperappAI.

Have it remove certain locks & restrictions like Google Play license verification that's prevents it from running, and then rebuild them to work on Uni OS and other open source distros like Lineage OS and Graphene OS.

*This is a technological arms race. And We will break Google and Androids Monopoly on app stores, by using Superior Technology and AI! and a low level engineering to counter any current and Future moves they make. Google's age verification requirement using a government-issued ID is also a form of surveillance and "digital ID" roll out, as Aaron Russo had warned us about. we will push back against that above all! This is especially important for journalists and people in high risks professions who could be tracked and killed by adversaries purely from the digital signatures emanated from their phone. Free people from the slavery and data and personal privacy nightmare that is the Google ecosystem and every one will benefit.

In order to keep the ecosystem healthy we will have a blockchain and smart contract-based compensation mechanism for app developers who have legitimate licensing concerns and revenue. We do not want to harm developers but only push back against tyrannical and abusive practices of "BIG tech".

This was inspired by limitations of APK pure and similar 3rd party download sites. Google Play licensing technology prevents many apps from being installed outside of Google Play! and without a Google account you cannot even use them. Google want to track everything you do mine your data and extract every single dime they can from you, by serving you useless content and adds across the entire platform and ecosystem. We consider this to be a grave excess! and they are no longer the "Don't be evil" start up they once were; but now a monolithic part of the surveillance and mind control industrial complex. It can't get worse than this.
