# AppReconstructor
Make an AI that can decompile apps, and also have it examine running code and memory on a standard & "licensed" install from Google Play rooted Android, to reconstruct apps! Have it remove certain locks & restrictions like Google Play license verification that's prevents it from running, and then rebuild them to work on Uni OS and other open source distros like Lineage OS and graphene!

This was inspired by limitations of APK pure and similar 3rd party download sites.

we will break Google and Androids Monopoly on app stores, by using Superior Technology and AI! and a low level engineering to counter any current and Future moves they make. Free people from the slavery and data and personal privacy nightmare that is the Google ecosystem and every one will benefit.

In order to keep the ecosystem healthy we will have a blockchain and smart contract-based compensation mechanism for app developers who have legitimate licensing concerns and revenue. we do not want to harm developers but only push back against tyrannical and abusive practices of "BIG tech".
